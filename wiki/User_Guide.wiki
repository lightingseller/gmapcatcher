After starting the programme the GUI shows the map, a small size scroll bar on the left and a toolbar on top.

By using the scroll bar the resolution/scale of the map can be changed. The toolbar consists of two rows and offers the following actions and settings (first row to second row, left to right):
  * *Main configuration button*
  Pressing the button opens a drop down menu with 5 configuration categories. Choosing one of them opens the complete programme setup where the chosen category is active.

  * *Drop down menu/edit field for new and stored locations*
  By using the drop down menu one of the stored locations is selected. By entering text a place with this name is searched (currently only available if online).

  * *Confirmation button*
  Confirms entered text in drop down menu/edit field (alternative to pressing 'ENTER' in edit field).

  * *Check box to indicate working mode (online or offline)*

  * *Check box to indicate force update facility*

  * *Download configuration button*
  Pressing the button opens a dialog for entering area and zoom level to download a map section. The dialog stays alive during the download.

  * *Drop down menu for map type (Map, Terrain, Satellite) selection*
  One of the three map types (Map, Terrain, Satellite) can be selected; a combination of satellite and text is currently not supported.
