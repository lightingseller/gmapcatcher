By using the scroll bar the resolution/scale of the map can be changed. The toolbar consists of two rows and offers the following actions and settings (first row to second row, left to right):
  * *Main configuration button*
  Pressing the button opens a drop down menu with 5 configuration categories. Choosing one of them opens the complete programme setup where the chosen category is active.

  * *Drop down menu/edit field for new and stored locations*
  By using the drop down menu one of the stored locations is selected. By entering text a place with this name is searched (currently only available if online).

  * *Confirmation button*
  Confirms entered text in drop down menu/edit field (alternative to pressing 'ENTER' in edit field).

  * *Check box to indicate working mode (online or offline)*

  * *Check box to indicate force update facility*

  * *Drop down menu for map type selection (Map, Terrain, Satellite)*
  One of the three map types (Map, Terrain, Satellite) can be selected; a combination of satellite and text is currently not supported.

== Download configuration button ==
  Pressing this button opens the following window for entering an area and a zoom level to download a map section. The dialog stays alive during the download.

  The centre of the downloaded area is defined by entering latitude and longitude. The size of the area by entering width and height. The maximum and minimum zoom level define the scale of the downloaded map tiles. The map type which is set in the drop down menu for 'map type selection' is used for the download.

  Action of buttons in bottom line of window:
    * left button: Start download
    * middle button: Open menu to restart/continue a previous download
    * right button: Cancel current download.

  How to update and/or modify a downloaded area? If you have e.g. downloaded the complete US with zoom level 4, now you want to update the NY area with zoom level 2, then you open the Download Window, simply enter the coordinates for NY and set the zoom level to 2, the range width and height to 50km and start the download. Now the NY area is updated the rest remains the same and the complete US is still available for offline viewing with zoom level 4 while NY is available with zoom level 2.

== Right mouse click ==

While displaying a map a right mouse click opens the following menu:

    * Zoom In: Decrease zoom
    * Zoom Out: Increase zoom

    * Reset: Display map with highest zoom level.

Actions of the other three items:
